# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

This project is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed to showcase fundamental React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and event handling. It allows two players to compete by taking turns to place their respective marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of aligning three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
